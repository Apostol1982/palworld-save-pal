## üöÄ Installation

Grab the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/oMaN-Rod/palworld-save-pal/releases) page and extract it to a folder of your choice.

## üéÆ Usage

Details for using Palworld Save Pal can be found in the [User Guide](https://github.com/oMaN-Rod/palworld-save-pal/wiki/%F0%9F%8E%AE-Usage)

## üê≥ Docker

To run Palworld Save Pal using Docker:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oMaN-Rod/palworld-save-pal.git
   ```

2. Run the build script based on your environment, these scripts capture the system IP address and set the environment variable for the svelte SPA:
   > Linux
   ```bash
   ./build-docker.sh
   ```

   > Windows
   ```powershell
   .\build-docker.ps1
   ```

3. Or you can follow these steps:
   1. Set the environment variable for the svelte SPA `ui/.env`. Replace `{{ ip_address }}` with the IP address of the server::

      ```env
      PUBLIC_WS_URL={{ ip_address }}:5174/ws
      PUBLIC_DESKTOP_MODE=false
      ```

   2. Build the SPA (replace bun with your package manager of choice). This will create a build directory in the project root containing the static files for the SPA:

      ```bash
      cd ui
      rm -rf .svelte-kit
      bun install
      bun run build
      ```

   3. Build the docker image:

      ```bash
      docker-compose up --build -d
      ```

## ‚û°Ô∏è Related Projects

These are projects I've found that specifically target PALWorld save files, each was helpful in some way during the development of this project:

- [PalEdit](https://github.com/EternalWraith/PalEdit) - PSP was inspired by it.
- [palworld-save-tools](https://github.com/cheahjs/palworld-save-tools) - PSP uses this tool for handling save files, can be used directly to convert to/from json.
- [palworld-uesave-rs](https://github.com/DKingAlpha/palworld-uesave-rs) - I originally considered building this app using Tauri, opted for using Python, but this project was helpful.
- [Palworld Pal Editor](https://github.com/KrisCris/Palworld-Pal-Editor) - Also served as a reference for Palworld Save Pal, adopted some of this projects approach.
